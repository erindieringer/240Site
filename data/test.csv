However, The information is NOT interactive, NOT easy to read, WEAKLY organized and LACKS intuitive data presentation. It is hard to find specifics and difficult to seee what fields of work students pursue",Our goal is to create a responsive website targeting current and prospective students and also parents who are interested in the IS program.

A series of projects are shown back to back, creating a long document with an overwhelming amount of information and users cannot immediately find information that they are looking for easily (e.g. trying to find a specific project). With the current layout and display of the project information, these users are not able to access the information they need in an easy way. Users cannot send information about individual projects because you can only access the information by looking at the entire PDF. This is not only frustrating for some users, but also incredibly time consuming.","The goal of our website is to portray information about the Information Systems Software Development Course (67-373) in a clear, concise, interactive, and visually appealing way. In addition, our goal is to lessen cognitive load by transforming the information into a more readable format that can be understood at a glance. We want to bring the value of visuals and readability, as well as less time wasted by using a website instead of the PDF. Therefore, we hope to make the website user-centered, through the use of search and filter functions for the 67-373 projects so that they can be sorted into many different categories and showing images that represent the project instead of all the information at once.",,"project3/screen1.png,project3/screen2.png,project3/screen3.png,project3/screen4.png","project3/wireframe1.png,project3/wireframe4.png"4,Fall 2017,Carnegie Mellon Information Systems Post-Graduate Statistics Redesign,"Angela Xie, Christie Chang, and Warren Glasner","Our group was tasked with redesigning the postgraduate statistics page for the Information Systems Major. Immediately, we recognized that the current iteration, being a PDF, was not an optimal way to engage people. Its layout is overloading in information and does not display the data in an appealing, interactive way.","Our first objective was to make this information interactive and the design appealing. We wanted to present the information in a simple, visually aesthetic way where the information itself is not too overloading. The interface will be highly navigable while communicating the most relevant information to the user. We aimed to have the website be very clear and intuitive so the users would spend minimum effort and time to find what they are looking for.

Each one links to a corresponding section of course content within the same page, displaying the course number, course name, and number of units for every course listed. Select courses also link to external PDFs with course descriptions and sample syllabi. While the information provided is useful, we identified some key issues with its current design: existing information is not accessible, navigation is inefficient and redundant, and course-related information is missing. With these issues, people often feel as though they have to schedule appointments with their advisor in order to clear up confusion that could be solved through redesigning the site.","Given these issues, our goal for redesigning the site were to help Information Systems students, as well as parents and other students interested in the Information Systems courses, to better extract the information they want. This meant making desired information more accessible, giving users more control over what information they want to see, streamlining navigation between content, painting a clearer picture of the overarching curriculum structure, and addressing frequently asked questions regarding double counting and other requirements.",http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/mecha/,"project5/screen1.png,project5/screen2.png,project5/screen3.png,project5/screen4.png","project5/wireframe1.png,project5/wireframe2.png"6,Spring 2018,CMU Dining Services,"Penelope McKeefry, Rachel Wong","This project offered us the opportunity to create a more attractive, user-friendly iteration of the CMU Dining Services mobile-web app. The problem-solving goals we strived to achieve with our site were reducing the cognitive load on the user, simplifying the user experience, and reducing the complex functionalities and redundancies of the original site. We wanted our design to also cater to many different user groups, as the current site really only caters to users who are very familiar with the campus, our user testing showed.","Our project was centered around the mobile design of the website. The client wanted to simplify the general mobile navigation and make it easier to use. They wanted to combine the two navigation bars, make both the entire card clickable and the google maps location link clickable, visualize which locations had today's soups and specials, sort the cards by open/close time and add a map to the top of the page. We developed the design with the 'mobile-first' approach as we saw the most common use case for the mobile experience would be someone physically on campus looking to find a location quickly.

Although the current site contains a large amount of useful information for helping current students, faculty, and prospective students find places to eat, our group believes that the site could benefit from a redesign. Specifically, we think the website can be improved in terms of user friendliness and content organization. Our design has improved usability of the website, especially for mobile users, with fewer scrolls, better visual hierarchy, and clearer navigation designs.","Our team's project vision was to redesign and develop a webpage that is mobile-friendly, enjoyable to use, and meets the needs of its main users. Our first main goal in redesigning the site was to make the site responsive, with a focus on the mobile version.

Our project team had the opportunity to work with Gary DiLisio, Principal Advisor of Information Systems, to revamp a current portion of the website that is used to display the major's course requirements and offerings. While the site contains some of the relevant information an IS student (or another user) may be seeking, it does so in a way that is not very effective. Not only does the site lack information regarding the structure of the curriculum, but it also does not clearly give users full context in terms of what courses (or how many) need to be completed to fulfill a particular requirement. Furthermore, the site provides users with links at the top that redirect you to a certain part of the page below. It can be difficult for users to navigate the page using these links while completely grasping everything the curriculum entails. We thus plan to make a solution that allows for easier navigation while giving a more holistic and in-depth view of the Information Systems Program. ","Our project team has indicated a few areas in which the information hierarchy and design of the current website can be significantly improved. Our design for the proposed solution centers around an improved navigation system. Currently, the site has a number of links at the top of the page that users click on to get redirected to a certain part of the page. We intend to replace this with a side navigation that incorporates the program's course categories (requirements). Further, we seek to display additional details for each course that is offered in the semester (course description, links to a syllabus, professor information, and which semester the course is offered in). We also want to better convey the requirements of the Information Systems program (degree) to users by only showing one chart to the user at a time and detailing how many units of a particular course type must be completed. We seek to make this solution mobile-responsive as well.

This information includes course names, course numbers, as well as what core group each course belongs to. It also includes information about how many core group courses the student needs to take and how many core groups the student must fulfill. The information is ultimately very useful, but unfortunately there are also many shortcomings with the way that the current site displays and presents the information which inevitably impedes upon its ability to perform its goal.The information was useful, but in order to find the area that was relevant, sometimes it would require great amounts of scrolling and searching.","We would like to redesign the site in such a way that allows consolidation of information on the site itself.

Often, potential students are unable to schedule campus tours for a variety of reasons, such as time conflicts. Also, there are almost no reliable sources of information the visitors can carry as they walk around the school, thus leaving them clueless until after their visit is over. While the school does provide websites, users not only are typically not mobile-friendly, but also found them disorderly and time consuming; therefore, the users are unable to collect all of the necessary information they need to make their decisions for college.","The virtual tour app will be made solely to be mobile-friendly.

However, the problem is that there are specific times, such as finals week, spring break, or holidays, when Andrew Ambassadors are not available to give tours. Or similarly, prospective students may have conflicting schedules with the tour dates and times, and miss out on this unique experience. Thus, potential admitted students may decline their offer from Carnegie Mellon just because they weren't able to get a sense of the academic and student life.","Instead of unnecessarily turning away students because of a scheduling conflict, we plan to create an application that will be a good resource for visitors who visit during off times and off hours (or even prospective students who can't make it to Pittsburgh), so they can get the same experience as that of an in-person tour. Our team originally envisioned for this project a well designed, easily navigable guide for prospective students to use when they visit campus. We hope to facilitate their decision to join the Carnegie Mellon community by showcasing the various student activities we have on campus.
