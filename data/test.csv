However, The information is NOT interactive, NOT easy to read, WEAKLY organized and LACKS intuitive data presentation. It is hard to find specifics and difficult to seee what fields of work students pursue",Our goal is to create a responsive website targeting current and prospective students and also parents who are interested in the IS program. We planned on offering a content-oriented yet visually satisfying website to make the information-navigating process less time-consuming and more visually intuitive.,www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/vy/,"project1/project4-1.png,project1/project4-3.png,project1/project4-4.png,project1/project4-5.png","project1/wireframe-1.png,project1/wireframe-3.png"2,Fall 2017,Remodeling the 67-373 Project Showcase Website,"Ryan Eckert, Ameeshi Goel, Patrick Tan","The  high-level  opportunity  presented  to  us  consisted  of  helping students'  advisors  in  the  Information  Systems  program  by  devising new  solutions  to  current  website.  We  as  a  team  were,  specifically, tasked  to  restructure  a  portion  of  a  website  that  showcases students'  projects  in  a  service  learning  course. The  page  currently provides  links  to  compiled  PDFs  for  each  academic  year. We  were required  to  provide  additional  visibility  for  students̥  projects  by making  the  information  available  to  users  through  an  interactive and  appealing  design. ","We  believed  that  the  way  these  projects  were  being  showcased could  be  drastically  improved.  By  deciding  to  build  a  hybrid  app for  iPhones,  we  sought  out  to  create  a  seamless  and  efficient  way to  browse  through  student  projects  without  scrolling  through  a  PDF file. By  showcasing  two  semesters  worth  of  projects  and  including visuals  of  individual  projects  and  team  members,  users  from  all segments  can  reach  their  goals  and  derive  value  from  the  app itself,  all  while  having  a  seamless  and  effortless  experience.

A series of projects are shown back to back, creating a long document with an overwhelming amount of information and users cannot immediately find information that they are looking for easily (e.g. trying to find a specific project). With the current layout and display of the project information, these users are not able to access the information they need in an easy way. Users cannot send information about individual projects because you can only access the information by looking at the entire PDF. This is not only frustrating for some users, but also incredibly time consuming.","The goal of our website is to portray information about the Information Systems Software Development Course (67-373) in a clear, concise, interactive, and visually appealing way. In addition, our goal is to lessen cognitive load by transforming the information into a more readable format that can be understood at a glance. We want to bring the value of visuals and readability, as well as less time wasted by using a website instead of the PDF. Therefore, we hope to make the website user-centered, through the use of search and filter functions for the 67-373 projects so that they can be sorted into many different categories and showing images that represent the project instead of all the information at once.",,"project3/screen1.png,project3/screen2.png,project3/screen3.png,project3/screen4.png","project3/wireframe1.png,project3/wireframe4.png"4,Fall 2017,Carnegie Mellon Information Systems Post-Graduate Statistics Redesign,"Angela Xie, Christie Chang, and Warren Glasner","Our group was tasked with redesigning the postgraduate statistics page for the Information Systems Major. Immediately, we recognized that the current iteration, being a PDF, was not an optimal way to engage people. Its layout is overloading in information and does not display the data in an appealing, interactive way.","Our first objective was to make this information interactive and the design appealing. We wanted to present the information in a simple, visually aesthetic way where the information itself is not too overloading. The interface will be highly navigable while communicating the most relevant information to the user. We aimed to have the website be very clear and intuitive so the users would spend minimum effort and time to find what they are looking for. The secondary objective was to promote networking between enrolled students and alumni by lowering the barrier of difficulties for reaching out.",https://github.com/christiechangcmu/postgradproject-team4,"project4/screen1.png,project4/screen2.png,project4/screen3.png,project4/screen4.png","project4/wireframe1.png,project4/wireframe2.png"5,Spring 2018,IS Course Page Redesign Project,Maddy Cha & Monica Chang,"The current Information Systems courses page for Carnegie Mellon University provides a site-map type structure at the start of its page representing the major sections of its curriculum. Each one links to a corresponding section of course content within the same page, displaying the course number, course name, and number of units for every course listed. Select courses also link to external PDFs with course descriptions and sample syllabi. While the information provided is useful, we identified some key issues with its current design: existing information is not accessible, navigation is inefficient and redundant, and course-related information is missing. With these issues, people often feel as though they have to schedule appointments with their advisor in order to clear up confusion that could be solved through redesigning the site.","Given these issues, our goal for redesigning the site were to help Information Systems students, as well as parents and other students interested in the Information Systems courses, to better extract the information they want. This meant making desired information more accessible, giving users more control over what information they want to see, streamlining navigation between content, painting a clearer picture of the overarching curriculum structure, and addressing frequently asked questions regarding double counting and other requirements.",http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/mecha/,"project5/screen1.png,project5/screen2.png,project5/screen3.png,project5/screen4.png","project5/wireframe1.png,project5/wireframe2.png"6,Spring 2018,CMU Dining Services,"Penelope McKeefry, Rachel Wong","This project offered us the opportunity to create a more attractive, user-friendly iteration of the CMU Dining Services mobile-web app. The problem-solving goals we strived to achieve with our site were reducing the cognitive load on the user, simplifying the user experience, and reducing the complex functionalities and redundancies of the original site. We wanted our design to also cater to many different user groups, as the current site really only caters to users who are very familiar with the campus, our user testing showed.","Our project was centered around the mobile design of the website. The client wanted to simplify the general mobile navigation and make it easier to use. They wanted to combine the two navigation bars, make both the entire card clickable and the google maps location link clickable, visualize which locations had today's soups and specials, sort the cards by open/close time and add a map to the top of the page. We developed the design with the 'mobile-first' approach as we saw the most common use case for the mobile experience would be someone physically on campus looking to find a location quickly.
