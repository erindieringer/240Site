				<h4> Course Evaluation: </h4>
				<p> The course is structured around a combination of class lectures, in-class applications, mini-projects, two exams and one group project. In order to successfully pass the course, students will be expected to complete the activities listed below. Weights listed between parentheses indicate the contribution of the specific component to the final course grade. The course evaluation components listed below are mandatory. Students do not have the option of opting out of any of the activities required for the assessment of these components.</p>
				<ul>
						<li> <b> Attendance, participation, reflection and quizzes (10%): </b>Students are expected to attend every class meeting, arrive on time and stay until the end. Regular and punctual attendance may be used, at the professor’s discretion, to make adjustments to the final grade in borderline cases. Active participation will help students achieve the best learning experience. Completing the readings indicated in the class schedule before class, and being fully present during each class will help students actively engage during each class meeting. Active participation includes active engagement during in-class activities and contributions through asking questions or providing answers when material is unclear. The professor will assume that you are well prepared for each class meeting and will feel free to call upon you to provide an answer or comment. Each absence will be penalized by 1% in the case where permission was not granted by the professor ahead of time. A maximum of three absences is allowed in one semester.</li><br>
						<li> <b>Individual mini-projects and JavaScript in-class activities (40%): </b> Individual mini-projects’ due dates are indicated in the course schedule. Start working on the mini-projects as soon as they are posted and manage your time wisely. You will be working on four mini-projects during the semester. Each mini-project is worth 9%. You will have 4 JavaScript in-class activities worth 4% (each activity will be worth 1%).</li><br>
						<li><b>Exams (20%): </b> This component of the final grade is based on performance on two individual exams. The exams are closed book and will cover all required readings, mini-projects, and in-class activities and discussions. Each exam is worth 10%. The exams’ dates are indicated in the class schedule.</li><br>
						<li><b> Group Project (30%): </b> This component of the final grade is based on one group project. Teams will consist of 3-4 students. Teams will propose their own projects under a common theme (to be specified later during the term). After the theme is announced, teams will have to go through an ideation phase before submitting a project proposal. Ideas will have to be approved by the instructor or TAs. Over the following weeks, each team will have to submit various deliverables including a project proposal, prototype wireframes and/ or user flow charts, market research, peer evaluations, progress reports, user testing evidence, presentation and final report (includes code or link to code repository). Teams are expected to submit all the deliverables in order to receive a final grade on the group project. Members are expected to contribute to every deliverable and be present in ALL group meetings and class presentations. Kindly be aware that peer evaluations can increase your final grade by 5% or reduce it by 15%. </li>
